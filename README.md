This is the last project in the "foundations" section of The Odin Project.

This project will cover all the basics that I covered over the time I was still learning the fundamentals.

I wrote comments documenting every step I took while making it. While the code may be inefficient and messy, it worked and I am constantly coming back to this project when I learn something new or after I apply an algorithm I never learnt before to make the code look better or to do something more efficient.

I also went out of my way to learn new concepts that weren't covered during The Odin Project's cirriculum to implement certain features like the algorithm for chaining multiple operations using a data structure called the "stack", or seperating functions to have two eventlisteners, one for clicks and the other for keys pressed.

Some quick notes about the Calculator:

* Pressing 'c' on the keyboard will call the "ClearEverything" function.
* The github image link opens the link in a new tab so you will not lose the current page you are on.
* Pressing "Equal" does not reset the Calculator for completely new numbers, you have to clear it yourself. This is done to allow doing multiple operations to be much simpler.

The link for the released page is: https://popusa.github.io/Calculator/

That's all I have to say about the project. If you encounter any bugs or want to inquire about the project or any other projects I have worked on, you can contact me at this email: danielmaged.3@hotmail.com

Thank you for taking the time to check this project out. Here's to more with the Full Stack Javascript Section!

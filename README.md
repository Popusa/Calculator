This is the last project in the "foundations" section of The Odin Project.

This project will cover all the basics that I covered over the time I was still learning the fundamentals.

I wrote comments documenting every step I took while making it. While the code may be inefficient and messy, it worked and I am constantly coming back to this project when I learn something new or after I apply an algorithm I never learnt before to make the code look better or to do something more efficient.

I also went out of my way to learn new concepts that weren't covered during The Odin Project's cirriculum to implement certain features like the algorithm for chaining multiple operations using a data structure called the "stack", or seperating functions to have two eventlisteners, one for clicking and the other for keyboard support.
